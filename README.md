## 🛑 Problem Statement

One day, my father and I visited the city of Guntur. On our return, we had very little time, and my father needed to buy some medicine. We didn’t know if the medicine was available, or which nearby store had it.

This scenario highlighted the challenge of finding products quickly and efficiently in local markets, especially when time is limited.

Find My Product (FMP) aims to solve this by providing a real-time, location-based product discovery platform, making product availability transparent, accessible, and quick to search.

## 📖 Overview

**FYP (Find Your Product)** is a location-based product search platform that helps users discover nearby vendors selling specific products.  
Users can search by product and location to find vendor listings, compare prices, and view contact details.  

Vendors can register, list products, and update availability in real-time.  

This project focuses on building a **scalable, user-friendly platform** that bridges the gap between **local buyers and sellers** in villages, towns, and cities.
